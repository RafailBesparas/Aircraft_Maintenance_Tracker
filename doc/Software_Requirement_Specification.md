# Software Requirements Specification

# 1. Introduction

- #### 1.1 Purpose

- The purpose of the Aircraft Maintenance Tracker system is to provide a simple and reliable tool to record, manage, and visualize aircraft maintenance activities, ensuring that maintenance schedules are respected to maintain operational safety and regulatory compliance.

- #### 1.2 Scope
- The system will enable users to:
- Add new aircraft records.
- View existing aircraft records. 
- Store records persistently in a PostgreSQL database.
- Alert users through the interface in case of data input errors (basic error handling).
- This application is developed using Java, Swing, and PostgreSQL following the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) design pattern to ensure modularity, maintainability, and traceability under DO-178C guidelines.
